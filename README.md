# Heap-and-Graph

This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms, including:

 Heap:
 maxheap.py: Implements a Max Heap data structure, including operations like insertion, deletion, and heapify.
sortheap.py: Demonstrates the use of the Max Heap to sort a list of elements.
heapify.py: Provides a function to build a Max Heap from a list of elements.
 Graph:
graph.py: Implements a Graph data structure, including operations for adding and removing vertices and edges, as well as traversal algorithms.
BFS & DFS.py: Demonstrates the use of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms on a graph.
 Usage
 Heap:
maxheap.py: Create a Max Heap instance and use the provided methods to insert, delete, and heapify elements.
sortheap.py: Call the heapsort() function to sort a list of elements using the Max Heap.
heapify.py: Use the heapify() function to build a Max Heap from a list of elements.
Graph:
graph.py: Create a Graph instance and use the provided methods to add and remove vertices and edges, as well as perform traversal algorithms.
BFS & DFS.py: Use the bfs() and dfs() functions to perform Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search on a graph, respectively.

Dependencies
This project requires Python 3.x. No additional dependencies are needed.
